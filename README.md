# React.js-App with jsx

Getting live data from git reposotories through git api's.

## How do I use this

### First time use
 - `npm install`
 npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server

### Local development
 - `npm run build`
 - `npm run start` (listens on localhost)
  - `npm run start true` (listens on machine's hostname)
 - `npm run test`
 - `webpack-dev-server` runs the webpack-dev-server with live reload

### Compatibility
This has been tested to build/run with node v5.1.0 and npm v3.5.3. Older version may not work.
